The answer depends on what kind of facts/statements you are talking about fact checking. Well defined, narrow-scoped statements like:

> *"US Unemployment went up during the Obama years"*

could be fact checked (debunked) automatically now with a reasonably amount of additional research.

But a statement like:

> *"The Russians under Putin interfered with the US Presidential Election”*

**won’t** be possible to fact check automatically until we've achieved human-level artificial intelligence capable of 
understanding subtle and complex human interactions, and conducting investigative journalism.

That's why we're focusing in round 1 of the **Fake News Challenge** (FNC-1) on the stance detection task that is tractable 
now (we think) and could serve as a useful tool for **human** fact checkers today if we had it.
