We are limiting the duration of the testing phase of FNC-1 to make it extremely difficult for teams to  cheat by labeling the test set manually. Given the test set size, this would be very difficult to do in the two day window we are providing. We apologize to teams who cannot work with the timeline weâ€™ve outlined.
