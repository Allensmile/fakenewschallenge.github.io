Yes! Here are two recent papers on related stance detection tasks to the one weâ€™re using for FNC-1:

 * [Ferreira & Vlachos, 2016](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1138.pdf)
 * [Augenstein et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05464)

There is also a very good 
[whitepaper on the state-of-the-art in automated fact checking](http://fullfact.org/media/uploads/full_fact-the_state_of_automated_factchecking_aug_2016.pdf) 
available from the UK fact-checking organization 
[FullFact.org](https://fullfact.org/).
